## üèÅ Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/harmish/agentic_ai_project.git
cd agentic_ai_project/AI_schedular
```

### 2. **Set Up the Environment**
Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (fast Python package manager):
```sh
pip install uv
```
Create and activate a virtual environment:
```sh
uv venv env --python cpython-3.10.18-windows-x86_64-none
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**
```sh
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. **Configure API Keys and Google Calendar**
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` and set:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```
**Google Calendar Setup:**
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and create OAuth2 credentials for a Desktop app.
2. Download the `credentials.json` file and place it in your project root.
3. The first time you use a calendar tool, a browser window will open for you to authorize access to your Google Calendar. A `token.pickle` file will be created for future use.

## üí° Example Usage & Testing

Try these commands in the UI:
- `Schedule a meeting with Alice at 2pm tomorrow.`
- `Delete all events between 2-7pm from tomorrow onwards.`
- `Find all events with the word "review" in the title.`
- `Show details for my 3pm meeting on Friday.`
- `When am I free next Thursday?`
- `How many hours of meetings do I have this week?`
- `Quick add: Call with John at 5pm Friday.`

The agent will remember context for up to 8 messages, so you can follow up with:
- `Now move them to 4pm.`
- `Delete those events too.`
